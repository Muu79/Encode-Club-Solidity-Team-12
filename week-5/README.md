# Team 12 Week 5 Lottery Dapp

## Architecture

Overall, this design concept seeks to create a sense of excitement around the lottery system, using dynamic animations and sound to capture the attention and imagination of users.

The Dapp interacts with two smart contracts: a token contract and a lottery contract. You can use the token contract as a standard ERC20 token or you can place bets with your tokens.

## Setup and running servers

Clone the parent directory `week-5` onto your computer.

### Dapp

Install the lottery dapp.

```bash
cd next-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

**Note**: we require minter's private key and your Alchemy API key. Put them in `backend/.env` file.

## Smart contracts

The smart contracts are in the `week-5/testing/contracts` folder.
